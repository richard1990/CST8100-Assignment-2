# CST8100 Assignment #2 - Loops
This was the second assignment I created in my "Intro to Computer Programming" course at Algonquin College. Written in Java, the program is a simple betting game where the player has $100 in their pot and based on what numbers come up on two six-sided die, they can either lose the money the bet, gain the bet amount, or gain double their bet amount. The game continues until the player runs out of money, which at that point they will be asked if they want to try again or not. The program only accepts valid integers.

If you both die are the same number, you win double your bet amount. You win your bet amount if the two die total 7 or 11 and lose your bet amount if the two die total 6, 8, or 9. Anything else has no effect on your pot (e.g. if the two die total 2).

The assignment introduced me to conditional statements, get and set methods, the Random class, and simple mathematical expressions. I enjoyed writing the conditional statements because they took some thought, such as writing the conditional statement where if the two die equal 5 or less, 10, or 12 and the two die are not the same number, then nothing happens to the bet amount.
